  ## Description
Welcome to BookDragon Cave! A place where, as a book lover, you can hoard and record your collection of books. 
  
**Technical stuff:** This is a full stack application using Google Books API. This was built using a MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB Atlas database, Node.js/Epress.js server and incorporates GraphQL API build with an Apollo Server.
